In terms of instrumentation, we're not like a normal band, each of us is in charge of different instruments and we don't have a specific one that we’re dedicated to. We usually play the songs that Nagai writes, and when I write a song, we all play it together, including the musicians around us, and record it."

The last album we made was called \"Tokyo Utopia Tsushin\". When we finished making it, we felt like we didn't have the confidence to make any more good music. But we still had to move on. In a way, we were caught in a quota or a challenge that we had set for ourselves, and I managed to write a song called \"Sachiko\", which I like very much, or \"Symphony\", which is Nagai's song. It was around 2003 when we started working with the idea that it would be nice to make music that we could listen to even when we were older, which is idealistic, but that’s how we felt. We like to listen to music that we can listen to every day and not get bored of it; that's what we want to achieve, and that's what we've been working especially hard on for the last 3 or 4 albums."

There is a part of me that feels like I have to do it in spite of that. Just recently, when I think back on the work on this album, when I listen back to the songs on it that we made, I think that it's a little bit different from us, that it's music that wouldn't have been told to the world if it wasn't for us. It's something that we're trying to achieve, of course, and we're trying to move forward as much as we can, and I've had the feeling recently that it's coming more naturally. I've been feeling more positive about making music lately. Until a while ago I used to lose sight of the meaning of what I was doing, but recently I've found a balance between the two, and although it's a personal problem, I feel like I'm able to work on my music in a positive way."
